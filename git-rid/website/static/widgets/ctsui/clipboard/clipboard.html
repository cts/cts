<H1>Cross-Site Cookie Server Page</H1> 

This page implements a cross-site cookie functionality using the html5
window.postMessage method.  It is not intended to be visited by human
beings; instead it is loaded by the cookie service to provide a
rendezvous for clients.

The cookie server provides an RPC protocol (via window.PostMessage)
for setting and getting cookies on the domain of this page.
<p>
Note that by design anyone can read these cookies, so you shouldn't
store sensitive data in it.  Also note that the cookie server works by
setting
so-called <a href="http://www.bobulous.org.uk/misc/third-party-cookies.html">third-party
cookies</a>, so a browser set to block those won't be able to use the
clipboard.
<p>
How does it work?  The clipboard is stored as a cookie associated with
this clip-server.html page.  clip-server.html loads clip-server.js which
implements the clipboard server.  It listens for window.postMessage
events asking it to get/set the clipboard value; it does so by
accessing the cookie and using window.postMessage to return the result
if necessary.
<p>
Below is a small inspection screen for testing the value of the cookie
named "clipboard".  Type to change the clipboard; click "refresh" to
update/paste from the clipboard after changing the clipboard
elsewhere:
<p>
<div><textarea id="clipboard"></textarea></div>
<div><input type="button" value="Refresh" id="button"></div>

<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="cookie-server.js"></script>

<script>
//debug/inspect scripts
CookieServer.show = function() {
    $("#clipboard").val(CookieServer.getCookie("clipboard"));
};

$("#clipboard").change(function () {
	CookieServer.setCookie("clipboard", $("#clipboard").val(), 7);
    });

$("#button").click(CookieServer.show);
CookieServer.show();
</script>
</body>
