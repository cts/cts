Hello, world!

Submitted paper to UIST yesterday; now trying to kick this thing out the door.

For posterity's sake, the original name was "Lossless Templates", which became
"Data Stylesheets", which became "Hierarchical Stylesheets", which became
"Hierarchical Cascading Stylesheets", which became "Tree Sheets", which became
CATS (Cascading Tree Sheets). 

Every website needs CATS on it.

Starting an empty repository with intent to rewrite the code such that it is
suitable for general-purpose use instead of just a research prototype. (unit
tests, here I come)
