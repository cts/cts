    li First, make sure you've performed all the setup steps for both the CTS server and the Quilt extension.
    li The only next steps are to create your own Google Spreadsheets and modify the example HTML to link to them.

  h2 Todo List
  p Create a Google spreadsheet that looks like this:
  img.example(src="/img/doc/setup/todo-sheet.png")
  ul
    li You must drag down the header bar to freeze the top row
    li You must enter two rows of example data (this is due to a quirk of how the Google Spreadsheet API works when in table mode)
    li The coloring of the cells does not matter
    li For this example, leave the worksheet with it's default name
  p Next, copy the google document key to your clipboard. This is the URL parameter named <code>key</code>, shown highlighted in this picture:
  img.example(src="/img/doc/setup/todo-url")
  p Finally, head to the <code>/website/static/examples/todo/index.html</code> file and replace the document key you see in that file with the one you copied.

  h2 Mortgage Calculator
  p Create a Google spreadsheet that looks like this:
  img.example(src="/img/doc/setup/mortgage-sheet.png")
  p No special coloring or sheet design are necessary for this one. But if you want the example HTML to work as-is, you'll need to make sure the cell coordinates all match.
  ul
    li The formula used in <b>B7</b> is <code>=ROUND(-PMT(B3/12,B4*12,B2),2)</code>
    li The formula used in <b>B8></b> is <code>=IF(LT(B3,5%), "TRUE")</code>
  p Next, copy the google document key, as with the <b>Todo</b> example.
  p Finally, head to the <code>/website/static/examples/mortgage/index.html</code> file and replace the document key you see in that file with the one you copied.
